## Description

This project is created for personal use. specifically too keep track of what I need to do regarding my programing journey.

This is my first project that makes use of `Typescript` and `Redux Toolkit`.

## Credits

I was able too build this project by doing research on [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

The biggest part of my learning came from youtube creators such as [Matt Pocock](http://www.youtube.com/@mattpocockuk), [developedbyed](http://www.youtube.com/@developedbyed), [Josh tried coding](http://www.youtube.com/@joshtriedcoding), [Web Dev Simplified](http://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified), [Kevin Powell](http://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) and [Tech with Tim](http://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim).

_This has been my first attempt at writing a README._
